# IRM (Incident Response Methodologies)

CERT aDvens provides easy to use operational incident best practices in french from the [CERT Societe Generale](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/IRM) IRMs.

These cheat sheets are dedicated to incident handling and cover multiple fields in which a CERT team can be involved.

One IRM exists for each security incident we're used to dealing with.

These cheats sheets have been written in English with CERT Societe Generale Team, translate into French and into Spanish by Francisco Neira from the [OAS](https://github.com/phrancisco/IRMs-SP).

CERT aDvens would like to thank [CERT SG](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/IRM) who accepted our contribution to update these cheat sheets.

Feel free to contact us if you identify a bug or an error in these IRMs.
